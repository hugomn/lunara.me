I was responsible for creating the responsive platform's UI/UX website. The design project was developed from April to June 2020.

### Design brief

The fundamental platform information, the target audience, and the desired design styleÂ were outlined in the design brief. The platform should transmit a modern, communicative, engaging spirit, and the liability idea at the same time.

The branding/identity creation you can check here.

### Wireframing

### Components

The components follow the branding and show a minimalist line.
