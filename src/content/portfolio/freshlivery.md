This mobile app design PoC was meant to be intuitive and innovative, with the branded fridges acting as a seamless and accessible way for people to access healthy meals. By simply scanning the QR code with your Freshlivery app, you can unlock the fridge, create a link to your account, and charge for the items you've selected. The app is designed with a clean and user-friendly interface, ensuring a hassle-free experience for users.

For those Users who prefer to have their fresh snacks and veggies delivered to their doorstep, the proposal also offers a reliable and efficient delivery service. The app is easy to use, allowing users to quickly place their orders and track the delivery time. There is also an Educational section where the User can gather some points and exchange them for some credits to purchase.

I worked on the whole User Journey and UX together with the team and came up with the wireflow. Afterward, I jumped into the UI Kit and screen building.
